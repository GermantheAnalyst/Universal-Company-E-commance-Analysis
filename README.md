##### This analysis aims to uncover revenue performance trends during the COVID-19 period (2019–2022), highlighting key revenue drivers and delivering actionable insights to guide strategic decisions across Operations, Sales, and Marketing leadership.


# Company Background
**Universal Electronics** is a global e-commerce company founded in 2018, specializing in popular tech products from brands like Apple, Samsung, and ThinkPad. Operating through both web and mobile platforms, it leverages email marketing, SEO, and affiliate channels to drive growth. With a rich dataset covering orders, customers, and geographic insights, Universal is committed to innovation and customer satisfaction.


<strong>Stakeholders Requirement:</strong></summary>


In Q3 2023, leadership commissioned this analysis to uncover how the COVID-19 pandemic shaped sales performance between 2019 and 
2022 —a transformative period for technology retailers marked by seismic shifts in consumer behavior, global supply chain turbulence, and the rise of remote work.

The findings will directly inform 2024 strategic initiatives, including optimizing loyalty programs, minimizing refund-related costs, and evaluating opportunities for global expansion. These insights are essential as we transition into a post-pandemic landscape, recalibrate for market normalization, and build resilience against future disruptions.

#### Key Strategic Questions Driving the Analysis (2019–2022):

- What were the overall sales trends during the pandemic years, and where did we see key inflection points?

- How did monthly and yearly growth rates evolve, and what patterns emerged across time?

- How effective was the new loyalty program in driving repeat purchases and revenue? Should we continue or refine it?

- What were the refund rates and average order values (AOV) across product categories, and how did they impact profitability

</details>

- In 2020, the company witnessed a remarkable surge in sales across all key metrics. **Revenue more than doubled, reaching £10 million, largely fueled by a twofold increase in order volume, totaling 33,000 orders**. The Macbook Air Lap emerged as the primary driver of this growth, with sales soaring by 384% compared to the previous year. Notably, March 2020 marked the highest month-over-month growth in the company's history, showcasing a 50% increase in revenue. This unprecedented rise can be attributed to heightened demand stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown measures.

- Since 2020, the company has found it challenging to maintain the elevated sales figures observed during the pandemic. As global activities normalized, Universal Electronics saw a Year-over-Year growth decrease, with revenue falling by 10% in 2021 and a more significant drop of 46% in 2022. The Average Order Value (AOV) and the number of orders have also exhibited a similar decline.

- The Apple iPhone presents a strong opportunity for revenue growth. **Despite low sales, its high AOV of £741 indicates untapped potential**. Targeted strategies to boost iPhone sales could leverage the existing demand for Apple products and significantly increase revenue

- The loyalty program launched in 2019 has exhibited significant potential for growth. Although non-loyalty members initially generated higher sales than loyalty members, this pattern has changed in recent years, with loyalty members now surpassing them in sales, order volume, and average order value showing stability. Maintaining and enhancing the program could foster further growth.

### Universal Electronics achieved total revenue of £28 million between 2019 and 2022, completing 108k orders in that period. The average order value (AOV) for the company over all these years is £260 per order.

### The organization launched a loyalty initiative in 2019 to encourage customers to shop more often. After five years, they are assessing whether to maintain the program.

<p align="center" width="100%">
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d9955a6-1285-456d-96ae-8de0c215cffc" width="800" height="500" /> 
</p>

</details>

### Key Insights:

- In Revenue, non-loyalty members have surpassed loyalty members, bringing in £17M versus £11M, with a generally higher average order value (with the exception of 2022).
- A shift in trends took place following the initial two years. From that point onward, members with loyalty programs have outperformed non-loyalty members in terms of revenue and order volume.

### Recommendation:
The available data does not offer a definitive conclusion regarding the impact of the loyalty program; however, the observed upward trend in the performance of loyalty members, particularly over the last two years, indicates a promising potential for future growth. It is noteworthy that the program was launched during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have influenced customer behavior, as evidenced by some customers transitioning from the loyalty program to standard customer status. 

Given these insights, it is advisable to retain the loyalty program while closely monitoring its performance in the coming years. The recent positive trends warrant further evaluation before any long-term decisions are made.

### Recommendations

Following the evaluation and findings, the team suggests the subsequent actions:

**Seasonal Promotions:**
Considering seasonal trends, we suggest that Universal Electronics explores the idea of launching strategic promotions to either take advantage of or mitigate these patterns. A few recommendations include:

**Fall Savings Event:** Utilize package discounts on high average order value items such as the iPhone and MacBook Air, employing a “Purchase More, Save More” strategy to encourage larger-value transactions.

**Summer Essentials Sale:** Tackle the summer sales dip by offering discounts on necessities (like chargers and headphones) and providing free shipping to enhance order volume.  

**End-of-Year Clearance:** Conduct a clearance sale from November to December on previous year's models, giving loyalty members exclusive early access and additional discounts to boost engagement.

**Product Lineup:**

The Bose Soundsport's consistently underwhelming performance over the years and across various metrics suggests it may be time to consider its removal or replacement. Collaborate with the product and sales teams to assess its viability and investigate possible alternatives to enhance the product portfolio.

**Strategies to Boost iPhone Sales:**

To leverage the Apple iPhone’s elevated average order value (AOV) and unexplored growth opportunities, the subsequent strategies are suggested:

**Target High-Spending Customer Segments:** Focus marketing initiatives on segments that exhibit high-value purchasing behaviors to boost iPhone sales. Primary targets consist of online customers (who have an average order value $257 greater than app users), loyalty program members (who spent more on average than non-members in 2022), and regions such as the US (which holds the highest sales volume), Japan, and the Netherlands (noted for having the highest average order values).


**Utilize Cross-Selling Potential:** Pair the iPhone with additional Apple products like the MacBook Air and Apple AirPods to promote related purchases and enhance the total transaction value.

The business ought to monitor how well these campaigns are performing by assessing changes in iPhone order quantities and average order value (AOV). This information should be utilized to enhance marketing strategies, adjusting them in response to customer reactions and trends in sales performance.

**Refund Rates:**
Collaborate with the product team to investigate the high refund rates of the ThinkPad and MacBook Air laptops with a focus on reducing the amount of refunds associated with Apple products
